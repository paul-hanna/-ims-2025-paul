week4: project description

I want to create a surveillance camera that detects faces and slowly starts to zoom in on them. I want it to be able to detect multiple faces.

Plan:

1. Use ml.p5 or other tracking library to get face tracking
2. Figure out how to get digital video manipulation so we "zoom" in on subjects
3. Create an interface that breifly snaps surveillance style photos/shows mutliple faces at once so it isn't just used by one person

Ideas:

Potentially add paramters for entire subject/face focus. Add parameters for potential filters/shaders?
