project description

panopticon, kinda

I want to create a surveillance camera that detects faces and slowly starts to zoom in on them. I want it to be able to detect multiple faces.

Plan:

Use ml5.js or other tracking library to get face tracking Figure out how to get digital video manipulation so we "zoom" in on subjects Create an interface that briefly snaps surveillance style photos/shows mutliple faces at once so it isn't just used by one person

Ideas:

Potentially add parameters for entire subject/face focus. Add parameters for potential filters/shaders?

Would like to add audio manipulation (though uncertain how viable). Microphone far away from screen, audio output from screen.

Person logs in, can control the camera? See a quick database of snapshots?
